# Minishell-2
UNIX program interpreter.
The command lines are advanced compare to minishell1, it means with pipe, redirection, double redirection and semicolons.
If an executable cannot be found, I display an error message.
I correctly handle the path and the environment.

Builtin : cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit.
The reference of my shell is tcsh.
